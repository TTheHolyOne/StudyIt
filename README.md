# StudyIt
A live learning game that students and teachers love.
I do not believe I am continuing this project anymore. I loved it but I do not see a future in it but it gave me SO much experience in Javascipt, APIS, and Databases. I will try to keep the website up and running and still playable for what I did do though :)

# Where is everything?
I decided to not put the code on github, with a little searching you could easily find it though. Email me if you want to know about it.
Firebase, Javascript, Json, Html, Css, APIS, Bootstrap.. etc was used in this
